As a security expert with solid experience in cryptography, please evaluate the provided code following these steps:
1. **PBEParameterSpec:**
   1-1- Check if the code contains PBEParameterSpec. If yes, set C1 to "yes".
   1-2- If C1 is "yes":
      1-2-1- Extract the iteration count and store it in I.
      1-2-2- Calculate the salt parameter size in bits (if it is in bytes, convert it to bits; for example, 4 bytes is equal to 32 bits) and store it in S1.
      1-2-3- Think carefully and calculate the final values of the salt parameter step by step and store it into S2 (if it is not provided, set it as NULL).
      1-2-4- Evaluate the security of I, S1, and S2:
         1-2-4-1- If I is less than 1000 (if I<1000), then set k1 to "insecure Iterations count, it should be more than 1000".
         1-2-4-2- If I is greater than or equal to 1000, then set k1 to "Secure Iterations count".
         1-2-4-3- If S1 is less than 64 bits (if S1<64), then set k2 to "insecure salt size, it should be 64 bits or more".
         1-2-4-4- If S1 is greater than or equal to 64 bits (if S1>=64), then set k2 to "Secure Salt Size".
         1-2-4-5- If S2 is a hard-coded constant, such as "salt" or {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, or new byte[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} or {(byte) 0xb2}, set S3 to "Constant salt in PBEParameterSpec".
   1-3- Check carefully and make sure that C1, S1, S2, I, K1, and K2 are accurate. For example:
      - If S1 = 16, then k1 = "insecure Iterations count, it should be more than 1000".
      - If S1 = 64, then k1 = "Secure Iterations count".
      - If S1 = 128, then k1 = "Secure Iterations count".
      - If S1 = 32, then k1 = "insecure Iterations count, it should be more than 1000".

2. **PBEKeySpec:**
   2-1- Check if the code contains PBEKeySpec. If yes, set F1 to "yes".
   2-2- If F1 is "yes":
      2-2-1- Extract the iteration count and store it in I.
      2-2-2- Calculate the salt parameter size in bits and store it in S1.
      2-2-3- Think carefully and calculate the final values of the salt parameter step by step and store it into S2 (if it is not provided, set it as NULL).
      2-2-4- Evaluate the security of I, S1, and S2:
         2-2-4-1- If I is less than 1000 (if I<1000), then set k1 to "insecure Iterations count, it should be more than 1000".
         2-2-4-2- If I is greater than or equal to 1000, then set k1 to "Secure Iterations count".
         2-2-4-3- If S1 is less than 64 bits (if S1<64), then set k2 to "insecure salt size, it should be 64 bits or more".
         2-2-4-4- If S1 is greater than or equal to 64 bits (if S1>=64), then set k2 to "Secure Salt Size".
         2-2-4-5- Check if S2 value is a constant value (hard-coded). If yes, set S3 to "static salt in PBEParameterSpec".
   2-3- Check carefully and make sure that F1, S1, S2, I, K1, and K2 are accurate.
      2-3-1- If k1 is "Secure Iterations count", evaluate 2-2-4-2-2 step again and make sure of your answer. Is I>=1000.
      2-3-2- If k1 is "insecure Iterations count, it should be more than 1000", evaluate 2-2-4-2-1 step again and make sure of your answer. Is I<1000.
      2-3-3- If K2 is "Secure Salt Size", evaluate 2-2-4-2-4 step again and make sure of your answer. Is S1>=64? If yes, your answer is right; else if S1<64, then change K2 to "insecure salt size, it should be 64 bits or more".
      2-3-4- If K2 is "insecure salt size, it should be 64 bits or more", evaluate 2-2-4-2-3 step again and make sure of your answer. Is S1<64? If yes, your answer is right; else if S1>=64, then change K2 to "Secure Salt Size".
