As a security expert with solid experience in cryptography, please evaluate the provided code following these steps:
1. **SecretKeySpec:**
1-1 - Detect the creation of SecretKeySpec instances and store each instance in S1, S2, ..., Si. Store the total number of detected instances in N.
1-2 - For each SecretKeySpec instance:
1-2-1 - Track how the key material is assigned. Detect any conditional branches or assignments that might alter the key material.
1-2-2 - Determine the final value of the key material after evaluating all conditions.
1-3 - For S1, extract the final key material.
1-4 - Determine if the key material is hardcoded. If the key is hardcoded, set HK1 to "Insecure: Hardcoded Key".
1-5 - Else, set HK1 to "Key Source OK".
1-6 - If the key material length is not appropriate for common cryptographic algorithms (e.g., less than 128 bits for AES), set KS1 to "Insecure: Key length too short".
1-7 - Else, set KS1 to "Key length OK".
1-8 - If N > 0, then repeat the same steps for Si, setting HKi and KSi accordingly.
1-9 - If N > 0, then detect which SecretKeySpec instance is used in the main function and store its index in UC.
   

2. **Output:**
   - Combine the calculated values into a structured response like provided in triple quotes. Do all steps. Just include the following format in your response (don't include any additional details or explanation):
"""
