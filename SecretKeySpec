As a security expert with solid experience in cryptography, please evaluate the provided code following these steps:
1. **SecretKeySpec:**
 1-1- Check if the code explicitly creates a SecretKeySpec instance with a defined key material. If yes, set SK to "yes". 
  1-1-1- If SK is "yes":
  1-1-2 - Calculate the final values of SecretKeySpec parameters step by step and determine if the key is hard-coded. Store the key material into PK variable. 
  1-1-3- Verify that the key is truly hard-coded by considering conditions and branches. 
  1-1-4- If the key is found to be hard-coded, set HK2 to "hardcoded key in SecretKeySpec".
   

2. **Output:**
   - Combine the calculated values into a structured response  like provided in  triple quotes. avoid more description.
"""
1-SecretKeySpec ->The value of SK +the value of HK2, the value of PK
"""
