**SSL/TLS and HTTP **

As a security expert with solid experience in cryptography, please evaluate the provided code following these steps:

X509TrustManager:
1-1 - Detect all instances where a custom X509TrustManager is implemented or used.
1-2 - For each instance, store it in T1, T2, ..., Ti, and track whether it correctly performs certificate validation.
1-3 - If the custom X509TrustManager does not properly validate certificates (e.g., empty implementations, returns without checks), set VT1 to "Insecure: Improper Certificate Validation".
1-4 - Else, set VT1 to "Secure: Proper Certificate Validation".
1-5 - For each trust manager, determine if it is used in SSLContext initialization.

SSLSocket:
2-1 - Detect all instances of SSLSocket creation and store each instance in S1, S2, ..., Si. Store the total number of detected instances in NS.
2-2 - For each instance, check if there is any configuration that disables hostname verification.
2-3 - If the hostname verification is disabled, set HS1 to "Insecure: Hostname Verification Disabled".
2-4 - Else, set HS1 to "Secure: Hostname Verification Enabled".
2-5 - Determine if SSL parameters are set up correctly for secure communication (e.g., enabling strong protocols and cipher suites).

HostnameVerifier:
3-1 - Detect all instances where a custom HostnameVerifier is implemented or used.
3-2 - For each instance, store it in H1, H2, ..., Hi, and track whether it performs proper hostname verification.
3-3 - If the custom HostnameVerifier always returns true or does not correctly verify hostnames, set VH1 to "Insecure: Improper Hostname Verification".
3-4 - Else, set VH1 to "Secure: Proper Hostname Verification".
3-5 - For each hostname verifier, determine if it is used in an SSL connection.

HTTP Connections:
4-1 - Detect all instances of HttpURLConnection, HttpsURLConnection or similar classes.
4-2 - For each instance, store it in C1, C2, ..., Ci, and check the security configurations.
4-3 - If using HttpURLConnection and not HttpsURLConnection for sensitive data, set HC1 to "Insecure: Unencrypted HTTP Connection".
4-4 - If using HttpsURLConnection, check for appropriate TLS settings and certificate verification.
4-5 - For HttpsURLConnection, if not using a properly set up HostnameVerifier or SSLSocketFactory, set HC1 to "Insecure: Improper SSL/TLS Configuration".
4-6 - Else, set HC1 to "Secure: Proper SSL/TLS Configuration".
