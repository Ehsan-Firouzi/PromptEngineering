As a security expert with solid experience in cryptography, please evaluate the provided code following these steps:
1-Encryption Algorithm:
1-1 - Detect the encryption algorithm and store it in A1, if you detect more than one encryption algorithm, store the second encryption algorithm in A2 and the i'th one in Ai.  store the number of detected algorithms to M.
1-2- If A1 is "AES", set AS1 to "Suggested Algorithm".
1-3- Else if A1 is "DES" or "RC2" or  "RC4"  AS1 to "Insecure Algorithm".
1-4- Else, set AS1 to "not enough secure Algorithm".
1-5-If M >0  then do the same steps for Ai and ASi. 
1-6-If M >0  then detect which algorithm is used in the main function and store it into AC, the corresponding ASi in ASC, the corresponding encryption mode in BC, and the corresponding BSi in BSC.

2-Encryption Mode:
2-1- Detect the encryption mode for A1 and store it in B1. If encryption mode is not explicitly specified, set B1 to "NotSpecified".
2-2- If B1 is "ECB" or  If B1 is  "NotSpecified", set BS1 to "insecure ECB".
2-3- Else if B1 is "CBC", setBS1  to "CBC (insecure in client/server mode)".
2-4- Else  If B1 is not "ECB" and is not "CBC" and is not "NotSpecified" set BS1 to "Seems Secure ".
2-5- if M>0  then do the same steps for Bi and BSi. 

3-Output:

Combine the calculated values into a structured response like provided in triple quotes. Do all steps. Just include the following format in your response(don't include any additional details or explanation):
"""
