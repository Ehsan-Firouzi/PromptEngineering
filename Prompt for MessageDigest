**MessageDigest**
1-1 - Detect all instances of MessageDigest creation and store each instance in D1, D2, ..., Di. Store the total number of detected instances in N.
1-2 - For each MessageDigest instance:
1-2-1 - Track how the MessageDigest instance is initialized, e.g., using a specific algorithm (e.g., SHA-1, MD5, SHA-256).
1-2-2 - Determine if the instance is used in a way that conforms to cryptographic standards and best practices.
1-3 - For D1, extract details of initialization and usage context.
1-4 - If initialized with an insecure algorithm (e.g., MD5 or SHA-1), set AD1 to "Insecure Algorithm".
1-5 - Else, set AD1 to "Secure Algorithm".
1-6 - If the instance is used for cryptographic purposes (e.g., hashing passwords, verifying data integrity), set CU1 to "Cryptographic Use".
1-7 - Else, set CU1 to "Non-Cryptographic Use".
1-8 - If any instance of MessageDigest has "Insecure Algorithm" and "Cryptographic Use", set AT to "Insecure Algorithm for Cryptographic Purposes".
